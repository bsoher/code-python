How To Document Your ... Overview
---------------------------------

We have divided this repository into algorithms, libraries, snippets and
utilities subdirectories. 

We ask slightly differnt levels of documentation for each type of 
contribution. More specific information and examples for each are listed 
in the 'howto_' and 'example_' files in each directory. But, here are 
some general principles (requests? even pleas!) to get you started.

algos - Shared code that provides working algorithms.
    - Please document each module at both the module level and within
      each function.
    - Embed a test using " if __name__ == "__main__": "
    - Embed a simple data set on which to run the test, otherwise document 
      where to get the test data.
    - Best case, embed a test and data AND a comparison to known results 
      to demonstrate that code is working correctly
        
libs - Shared collections of code (a library) that provide working
       algorithms/utilities/etc.
    - Please document each module at both the module level and within
      each function.
    - Document the __init__.py module with an overview of what the library
      does and any dependencies or limitations.
    - Embed a test using " if __name__ == "__main__": "
    - Embed test data or document where to get test data.
    - Best case, embed a test and data AND a comparison to known results 
      to demonstrate that code is working correctly
        
snips - Contains example code about how to do something. These do not 
        necessarily have to be fully working example.
    - Please thouroughly document each module within each function,
      especially if it is non-working code.
    - If possible, embed a test using " if __name__ == "__main__": "
        
utils - For shared code that provided working utility functions.
    - These are 'non-algos' modules/functions that could be of use to users.
        - example: data conversion, plotting, etc.
    - Please document each module at both the module level and within
      each function.    
    - Embed a test using " if __name__ == "__main__": "
    - Embed a simple data set on which to run the test, otherwise document 
      where to get the test data.
